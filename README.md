## Activate Your GA4 BigQuery Data with dbt

Welcome to the workshop starter project. 

This is a partially configured project that will let us do all of the important configuration tasks and get on to using the base package to do interesting things with your data withoug spending too much time on configuration.

The Resources section also includes links to templates and scripts that we will be using during the workshop.

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
